Project Title: FinancePro
Description: 

 FinancePro is a CMU-designed paper trading account. The app is complete with an interface to build your own personal portfolio of publicly traded stock on the NASDAQ	. Users begin with $10,000 liquid cash and are allowed to make trades at any time of the day. Purchasing stock reduces their cash amount while selling stock increases the cash amount. Stock prices are updated to the latest minute during open market hours(9:30AM-4PM Monday-Friday except for holidays) and set to market close prices after trading hours. The data displayed of your portfolio include which companies you have purchased, each transaction completed, the price it was bought at, number of shares purchased, the value of the transaction and the percent value that your portfolio currently occupies. Data is downloaded from Yahoo Finance. Users have the ability to view the stock charts of stocks in their current portfolio and adjust the timeframe of the data to 1 day, 5 day, 1 month, 1 year, and 5 years from the current day. Lastly, each stock chart is complete with an orange dashed line representing the current price of the stock, a red dashed line representing the lowest stock price in the timeframe, and a green dashed line representing the highest stock price in the timeframe.
